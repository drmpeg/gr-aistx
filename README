This directory contains a custom block for GnuRadio we called AIS Frame Builder.
It is part of the AIS BlackToolkit.
 
This block serves as generator of AIS frames and implements the full AIS stack.
It is composed of three main components covering respectively the 
application/presentation layers, the link layer and the physical layer, 
as defined in the protocol specification for AIS.
